# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a multi-tenant REST API for generating and sending electronic documents that comply with Costa Rica's Ministry of Finance regulations (Version 4.4). The API will serve as a stateless, scalable backend for multiple frontends and vertical systems, using FastAPI with PostgreSQL (Supabase) as the database.

The system must support all official electronic document types defined by the Costa Rican tax authority and comply with the UBL 2.1 standard with country-specific extensions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenant Architecture
