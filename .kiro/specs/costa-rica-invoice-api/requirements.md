# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a multi-tenant REST API for generating and sending electronic invoices that comply with Costa Rica's Ministry of Finance regulations. The API will serve as a stateless, scalable backend for multiple frontends and vertical systems, using FastAPI with PostgreSQL (Supabase) as the database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenant Architecture

**User Story:** As a SaaS provider, I want to support multiple clients (tenants) with isolated data and configurations, so that each business can use the API independently with their own certificates and settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new tenant is created THEN the system SHALL store their business information including legal ID, company name, and contact details
2. WHEN a tenant uploads their P12 certificate THEN the system SHALL encrypt and securely store it with the associated password
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL authenticate using tenant-specific API keys
4. IF a tenant exceeds their monthly invoice limit THEN the system SHALL reject new invoice creation requests
5. WHEN tenant data is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure complete data isolation between tenants

### Requirement 2: Electronic Invoice Generation

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to generate electronic invoices that comply with Costa Rica's tax regulations, so that I can legally bill my customers and meet government requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invoice is created THEN the system SHALL generate a valid UBL 2.1 XML structure
2. WHEN generating the consecutive number THEN the system SHALL follow the format "00200001010000076513" (Branch + Point of Sale + Doc Type + Sequential)
3. WHEN creating the invoice key THEN the system SHALL generate a 50-character key following the official format
4. WHEN processing invoice details THEN the system SHALL validate CABYS codes against the official database
5. WHEN calculating taxes THEN the system SHALL apply the correct IVA rate (13%) and generate proper tax breakdowns
6. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return detailed validation errors

### Requirement 3: Digital Signature and Ministry Integration

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want my invoices to be digitally signed and sent to the Ministry of Finance automatically, so that they are legally valid and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invoice is created THEN the system SHALL digitally sign the XML using the tenant's P12 certificate
2. WHEN the XML is signed THEN the system SHALL validate it against official XSD schemas
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL send the invoice to the Ministry of Finance API
4. WHEN the Ministry responds THEN the system SHALL store the signed XML response and update invoice status
5. IF the Ministry rejects the invoice THEN the system SHALL store the error details and allow for corrections
6. WHEN certificate expiration approaches THEN the system SHALL notify tenants 30, 15, and 7 days in advance

### Requirement 4: API Authentication and Security

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want secure API access with proper authentication and rate limiting, so that I can safely integrate with the invoicing system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL require a valid API key in the X-API-Key header
2. WHEN API keys are generated THEN they SHALL be at least 32 characters long and cryptographically secure
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with retry-after headers
4. IF invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt certificates and passwords using AES-256

### Requirement 5: Invoice Management and Retrieval

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to view, search, and download my invoices and their XML files, so that I can manage my billing records effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing invoices THEN the system SHALL support pagination with configurable page sizes
2. WHEN searching invoices THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, status, and customer information
3. WHEN requesting invoice details THEN the system SHALL return complete invoice information including line items
4. WHEN downloading XML THEN the system SHALL provide both original and Ministry-signed versions
5. WHEN checking invoice status THEN the system SHALL show current processing state and any error messages

### Requirement 6: CABYS Code Management

**User Story:** As an invoice creator, I want to search and select appropriate CABYS codes for my products and services, so that my invoices comply with tax classification requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching CABYS codes THEN the system SHALL provide full-text search across descriptions
2. WHEN CABYS results are returned THEN they SHALL include code, description, and category information
3. WHEN validating invoice items THEN the system SHALL verify CABYS codes exist in the database
4. WHEN the CABYS database is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing invoices

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and audit logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain compliance records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with specific error codes
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log all authentication attempts and their outcomes
3. WHEN invoices are processed THEN the system SHALL log all Ministry interactions including responses
4. WHEN certificates are modified THEN the system SHALL create audit trail entries
5. IF system errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want the API to handle high loads efficiently, so that multiple tenants can use the system simultaneously without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing invoice requests THEN the system SHALL respond within 3 seconds on average
2. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations safely
3. WHEN certificates are accessed THEN they SHALL be cached in Redis for improved performance
4. WHEN XSD validation is performed THEN schemas SHALL be loaded in memory for fast access
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL use appropriate indexes for optimal performance

### Requirement 9: Development and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want comprehensive documentation and development tools, so that I can implement integrations quickly and correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN interactive documentation SHALL be available at /docs endpoint
2. WHEN viewing documentation THEN it SHALL include complete request/response examples
3. WHEN setting up development environment THEN Docker Compose SHALL provide all required services
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit and integration test suites
5. WHEN deploying THEN environment-specific configurations SHALL be managed through environment variables
